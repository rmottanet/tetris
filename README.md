# Tetris in JavaScript

Welcome to Tetris in JavaScript! This project is a classic arcade game implementation where you control falling tetrominoes, aiming to clear lines by forming complete rows. This game is built using **pure JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, making it ideal for direct execution in the browser and easy hosting on platforms like GitHub Pages.


## Requirements

To play Tetris in JavaScript, all you need is:

* A modern **web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).


## Dependencies

Tetris in JavaScript is a **self-contained** project, meaning it doesn't require any external JavaScript libraries or frameworks. It only uses native browser functionalities:

* **HTML:** To structure the page and include the `<canvas>` element.
* **CSS:** For basic styling and centering the game.
* **JavaScript:** For all game logic and `<canvas>` manipulation.


## Usage

You can play Tetris in JavaScript in two ways:

### 1. Locally in Your Browser

1.  **Download the Project:** Download or clone this repository to your computer.
2.  **Open `index.html`:** Navigate to the project folder and open the `index.html` file directly in your browser. The game will load and start automatically.

### 2. Via GitHub Pages

This project is set up to be easily hosted on GitHub Pages. If you wish to host your own version:

1.  **Create a GitHub Repository:** Create a new public repository in your GitHub account.
2.  **Upload the Files:** Upload the `index.html` and `script.js` files (and any other relevant files, if any) to the root of your repository.
3.  **Configure GitHub Pages:**
    * Go to your repository's **Settings**.
    * In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
    * Under "Source," select the branch that contains your code (usually `main` or `master`) and the `/(root)` folder.
    * Click **Save**.
4.  **Access the Game:** After a few minutes, GitHub Pages will build and publish your site. You'll be able to access it at a URL in the format: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`


## Controls

* **Left/Right Arrow Keys:** Move the current piece horizontally.
* **Down Arrow Key:** Accelerate the piece's descent.
* **Up Arrow Key / 'X' Key:** Rotate the current piece clockwise.
